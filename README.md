# spring-api-demo

Welcome to the Spring API Demo project! This repository contains a simple website demo that utilizes restful API. The frontend of the project can be accessed through the following link:

Please note - 
1.that the newest update of this demo website's backend/frontend is always in this Git repository (not the link provided above), I only deploy the newest version when I have time;
2.that the first-time click may take about 30 seconds to launch the page due to the cloud's idle time. Subsequent access will be faster as the cloud resources become active.

## About

This project serves as a showcase of my skills in website building and API integration. I dedicated my evenings and weekends to create this demo, aiming to demonstrate my proficiency in utilizing a restful API and creating a functional frontend.

## Future Plans

I have plans to further enhance this project by gradually incorporating a database and additional services. This will transform the demo into a more comprehensive portfolio piece, showcasing my ability to work with various technologies and build more complex applications.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally or explore its source code, please visit the GitHub repository:

Feel free to explore the code, experiment with the API, and provide any feedback you may have. I'm excited to continue developing this project and further refining my skills.

Thank you for taking the time to explore this demo!

Best regards,
